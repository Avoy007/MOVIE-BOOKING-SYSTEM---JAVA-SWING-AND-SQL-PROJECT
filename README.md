# MOVIE-BOOKING-SYSTEM---JAVA-SWING-AND-SQL-PROJECT
The Movie Booking System is a desktop app that simplifies ticket booking. Users can view movies, choose showtimes, select seats, and book tickets using a Java Swing interface. It connects to a MySQL database to manage movies, users, and bookings in real time, reducing manual work and preventing double bookings.
